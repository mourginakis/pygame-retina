Simple demo showing how to get MacOS retina resolution text on arcade or pygame

The problem here is that if you use integrated fonts with pygame or arcade, the retina scaling does not work properly and looks fuzzy and antialiased. Really ugly.

You can encode the fonts directly into the file and work at ultra high, ultra crisp resolutions.

Also you can run both of these with jurigged for instant feedback and hot reloading. This is an amazing workflow.
